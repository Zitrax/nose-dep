## Nosetest plugin for test dependencies

Normally tests should not depend on each other - and test dependencies should
be avoided as long as possible. Optimally each test should be able to run
in isolation.

However there might be rare cases or special circumstances where one would
need dependencies. For example very slow integration tests where redoing what
test A did just to run test B would simply be too costly. Or temporarily while
testing or debugging.

The current implementation allows marking tests with the `@depends` decorator
where it can be declared if the test needs to run before or after some
other specific test(s).

There is also support for skipping tests based on the dependency results,
thus if test B depends on test A and test A fails then B will be skipped
with the reason that A failed.

Nosedep also supports running the necessary dependencies for a single test,
thus if you specify to run only test B and test B depends on A; then A will
run before B to satisfy that dependency.
